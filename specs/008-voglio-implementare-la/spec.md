# Feature Specification: Serverless Architecture con Storage Cloudflare R2

**Feature Branch**: `008-voglio-implementare-la`
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "voglio implementare la nuova architettura"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Architecture redesign: eliminate dedicated backend, use serverless + R2
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: organizers, participants, system (scheduled cleanup)
   ‚Üí Actions: upload presentations, download files, automatic cleanup
   ‚Üí Data: presentation files (PDF/PPT), metadata
   ‚Üí Constraints: 48-hour retention, file size up to 1GB, ~20-30 events/week
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clarified through discussion
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úì Clear upload/download flows identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úì Each requirement testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí ‚úì Events, sessions, slides with R2 storage keys
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úì No implementation details in spec
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As an event organizer**, I want to provide presentation materials to participants for a limited time after the event without managing complex infrastructure or paying high costs, so that participants can access materials when they need them and files are automatically cleaned up afterward.

**As a participant**, I want to download individual presentation files from an event I attended in the past 48 hours, so that I can review the material at my convenience.

**As the system**, I want to automatically delete files older than 48 hours to manage storage costs and comply with retention policies.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an organizer has uploaded a 200MB presentation during an event,
   **When** a participant requests to download it within 48 hours,
   **Then** the system provides immediate access to the file

2. **Given** multiple files (up to 1GB each) are uploaded for a session,
   **When** participants download them,
   **Then** downloads complete successfully without backend load or timeout issues

3. **Given** a file was uploaded 48 hours and 10 minutes ago,
   **When** the automatic cleanup runs,
   **Then** the file is deleted from storage and marked as unavailable

4. **Given** 25 events occur in one week with an average of 10 presentations each,
   **When** storage usage is measured,
   **Then** total storage remains within cost-effective limits (under 15GB active files)

5. **Given** an organizer uploads a 900MB presentation file,
   **When** the upload process executes,
   **Then** the upload completes successfully without size-related failures

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a participant tries to download a file after 48 hours have elapsed?
  ‚Üí System displays "File no longer available" message

- How does the system handle concurrent uploads of large files (multiple 1GB files)?
  ‚Üí Each upload proceeds independently without affecting others

- What happens if cleanup job fails or is delayed?
  ‚Üí Files may remain slightly longer than 48h but next cleanup cycle will catch them

- How are download permissions enforced for private events?
  ‚Üí Access tokens validate user access before providing download links

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow organizers to upload presentation files up to 1GB in size
- **FR-002**: System MUST support common presentation formats (PDF, PPT, PPTX) with average sizes of 50MB and occasional files up to 200MB
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow participants to download individual presentation files directly
- **FR-004**: System MUST retain uploaded files for exactly 48 hours from upload time
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically delete files older than 48 hours via scheduled cleanup
- **FR-006**: System MUST track file metadata (filename, size, upload timestamp, deletion timestamp) in database
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate user access permissions before allowing downloads for private events
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle 20-30 events per week with approximately 10 presentations per event
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide fast download speeds via global CDN distribution
- **FR-010**: System MUST operate without requiring a dedicated always-on backend server
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate time-limited access URLs for secure file downloads
- **FR-012**: System MUST prevent unauthorized access to uploaded files
- **FR-013**: System MUST track which files have been deleted during cleanup operations

### Key Entities

- **Event**: Represents a meeting or conference with a specific date; contains multiple sessions; has retention policy of 48 hours after upload
- **Session**: A specific talk or presentation within an event; contains multiple presentation files
- **Presentation File**: Individual PDF or PowerPoint file uploaded by speaker; stored with unique identifier; tracks upload timestamp for retention enforcement; maximum size 1GB
- **File Metadata**: Database record tracking filename, storage reference, upload time, size, deletion status; enables cleanup operations and access control
