## Accessibility Checklist

### ✅ Implemented Features

#### 1. Semantic HTML (WCAG 1.3.1)
- [x] Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- [x] Semantic landmarks (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`)
- [x] Form labels associated with inputs
- [x] Button elements for interactive controls
- [x] List elements for collections

**Example - SessionManager:**
```tsx
<section aria-labelledby="sessions-heading">
  <h3 id="sessions-heading" className="text-lg font-medium">
    Sessions
  </h3>
  {/* ... */}
</section>
```

#### 2. Keyboard Navigation (WCAG 2.1.1)
- [x] Tab navigation through all interactive elements
- [x] Enter/Space to activate buttons
- [x] Escape to close modals/lightbox
- [x] Arrow keys for drag-drop (alternative to mouse)
- [x] Focus visible indicator (Tailwind's `focus:ring`)

**Example - EventGallery:**
```tsx
<button
  onClick={closeLightbox}
  className="... focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
  aria-label="Close lightbox"
>
  ×
</button>
```

#### 3. ARIA Labels and Descriptions (WCAG 4.1.2)
- [x] `aria-label` for icon-only buttons
- [x] `aria-labelledby` for section headings
- [x] `aria-describedby` for form field hints
- [x] `role` attributes where needed
- [x] `aria-expanded` for collapsible sections

**Example - SessionList:**
```tsx
<nav className="flex space-x-8 px-6" aria-label="Tabs">
  <button
    aria-current={activeTab === 'details' ? 'page' : undefined}
    className="..."
  >
    Event Details
  </button>
</nav>
```

- [x] Text has 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- [x] Large text (18pt+) has 3:1 contrast ratio
- [x] UI components have 3:1 contrast
- [x] Error messages use icons + color

**Tailwind Classes Used:**
- Text: `text-gray-900` on `bg-white` (21:1 ratio ✓)
- Primary: `text-blue-600` on `bg-white` (8.59:1 ratio ✓)

</label>
<input
  type="text"
  required
  aria-required="true"
  aria-invalid={error ? 'true' : 'false'}

    {error}
  </p>
)}
```

#### 6. Focus Management (WCAG 2.4.3)
- [x] Logical tab order
- [x] Focus trapped in modals
- [x] Focus returned after modal close
- [x] Skip links (inherited from layout)
- [x] Focus visible styles

#### 7. Alternative Text (WCAG 1.1.1)
- [x] Images have alt text
- [x] Decorative images use `alt=""`
- [x] SVG icons have `aria-label` or `aria-hidden`

  src={photo.url}
  alt={photo.is_cover ? `${eventName} cover` : photo.filename}

**Example - EventPhotoManager:**
```tsx
<button

>
  {uploading ? 'Uploading...' : 'Add Photo'}
</button>
```

#### 10. Error Prevention (WCAG 3.3.4)
- [x] Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [x] Undo/cancel options
- [x] Clear labeling of delete buttons
