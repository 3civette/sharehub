## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A conference attendee receives a link to the ShareHub event page after attending a session. They want to:
1. Quickly understand what the event was about
2. See who spoke and what topics were covered
3. Download presentation slides they found interesting
4. View photos from the event
5. Share specific sessions with colleagues

The page must be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and work perfectly on mobile devices since many attendees will access it on their phones.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits an event page URL, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a professional, branded event header with event name, date, description, and key metrics (views, downloads, participants)

2. **Given** an event has multiple sessions, **When** the user scrolls through the page, **Then** sessions are organized clearly with session name, time, speaker, and available materials prominently displayed

3. **Given** a user wants to download slides, **When** they click on a slide link, **Then** the download starts immediately with clear feedback, and the download count increments

4. **Given** an event has photos, **When** the user reaches the photo gallery, **Then** photos are displayed in an attractive grid layout with lightbox capability for full-screen viewing

5. **Given** a user is on mobile, **When** they access any part of the event page, **Then** all content is fully responsive, touch-friendly, and maintains visual hierarchy

6. **Given** the event is private, **When** an unauthorized user visits, **Then** they see a clean token input form explaining how to access the event

7. **Given** advertisement banners are configured, **When** the page loads, **Then** banners appear at designated positions (header, content, footer) without disrupting the content flow

8. **Given** a user shares the page URL, **When** the link is posted on social media, **Then** rich preview metadata displays correctly (Open Graph/Twitter Cards)

### Edge Cases

- **Loading Performance**: What happens when the event has 50+ sessions with large slide files? Page must remain performant with lazy loading and progressive enhancement

- **No Content**: How does the page look when an event has no sessions, no photos, or no description? Must gracefully handle empty states with helpful messaging

- **Long Content**: What happens with very long event names, session titles, or speaker names? Text must truncate elegantly or wrap appropriately

- **Network Issues**: How does the page behave on slow connections? Critical content loads first, images lazy-load, error states are clear

- **Token Expiration**: What happens when a private event token expires mid-session? User receives clear messaging about re-authentication

- **Banner Loading Failures**: What happens if advertisement banners fail to load? Page content remains stable, no layout shift or broken elements

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-14

**Q1: Mobile Navigation Pattern (FR-015)**
- **Question**: Which mobile navigation approach should we implement?
- **Answer**: C - In-page section headers with clear visual dividers and optional "back to top" button
- **Rationale**: Simplest approach, natural scrolling behavior, no overlay complexity, works well for linear content consumption
- **Impact**: FR-015 updated to specify in-page navigation pattern

**Q2: Session Organization (FR-006)**
- **Question**: How should sessions be organized and displayed on the event page?
- **Answer**: C - Chronological with optional filter (default chronological list + client-side filter buttons for tracks/topics)
- **Rationale**: Balances simplicity (default chronological) with flexibility (optional filtering), no complex grouping logic, works for events with or without tracks
- **Impact**: FR-006 updated to specify chronological default with optional client-side filtering

**Q3: WCAG Contrast Ratios (FR-040)**
- **Question**: Which WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio standards should we target?
- **Answer**: C - Contextual AA (4.5:1 minimum for body text, 3:1 for secondary/decorative elements)
- **Rationale**: Meets legal compliance for primary content while allowing design flexibility for non-critical elements, pragmatic approach
- **Impact**: FR-040 updated with specific contrast ratio requirements for different content types

**Q4: File Information Display (FR-023)**
- **Question**: How should file type and size information be displayed for downloadable slides?
- **Answer**: C - Hybrid approach (file type icon always visible, size on hover/tap)
- **Rationale**: Balances information availability with clean UI; type icon provides context, size on-demand reduces clutter
- **Impact**: FR-023 updated to specify hybrid display approach with responsive behavior

**Q5: Bulk Download Scope (FR-024)**
- **Question**: What should the bulk download feature encompass?
- **Answer**: A - Per-session only (each session has "Download all slides" button)
- **Rationale**: Simpler implementation, focused user intent (users typically interested in specific sessions), lower server load, avoids massive ZIP files
- **Impact**: FR-024 updated to specify per-session bulk download functionality

### Deferred to Planning Phase

The following clarifications involve implementation details that can be determined during planning without blocking specification approval:

**FR-044 (Analytics Tracking)**: Specific interactions to track (page views, downloads, clicks) can be determined during planning based on analytics infrastructure and business requirements.

**FR-045 (Metrics Update Frequency)**: Polling interval and caching strategy can be optimized during implementation based on server load testing and user experience requirements.

### Clarification Session Summary

| Category | Status | Count | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Resolved** | ‚úÖ | 5 | Mobile nav, session organization, contrast ratios, file info display, bulk download scope |
| **Deferred** | ‚è∏Ô∏è | 2 | Analytics tracking details, metrics polling - implementation details for planning phase |
| **Outstanding** | ‚ùå | 0 | None |
| **Total Identified** | ‚Äî | 7 | All clarifications addressed |

**Outcome**: Specification ready for planning phase. No blocking ambiguities remain. Deferred items (FR-044, FR-045) involve implementation optimizations that can be determined during technical design.

## Notes for Planning Phase

**Current Issues to Address**:
- Existing page reportedly shows errors (needs diagnosis in planning)
- Layout likely not optimized for mobile experience
- Visual design may not be modern or professional
- Component organization may need restructuring

**Design Priorities**:
1. **Mobile-First**: Given industry trends, majority of users will access on mobile
2. **Performance**: Large events with many sessions must remain fast
3. **Clarity**: Information hierarchy must make scanning easy
4. **Professional Polish**: Represents the event organizer's brand

**Success Metrics** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific targets?]:
- Page load time under 2 seconds
- Bounce rate reduction
- Increased slide download engagement
- Positive user feedback on navigation/usability
- Mobile conversion rate parity with desktop
