## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13
- Q: How many banner slots should each event have? ‚Üí A: Configurable per event, up to 5 individually activable slots
- Q: Should banners be clickable links that redirect visitors to external URLs? ‚Üí A: Yes, click URL is optional (some banners may be non-clickable)
- Q: What are the file requirements for banner uploads? ‚Üí A: JPEG/PNG/WebP, max 5MB, recommended dimensions 1200x300px
- Q: Who can manage (upload, delete, edit) banners for an event? ‚Üí A: All admins with access to the tenant (the agency or hotel organizing the event)
- Q: How should banners be assigned to slots and displayed? ‚Üí A: Each banner is assigned to a specific slot (1-5); one banner per slot
- Q: Should banners have scheduled visibility (start/end dates)? ‚Üí A: No scheduling - banners remain visible as long as the event is publicly accessible
- Q: Should the system track banner impressions or clicks? ‚Üí A: No tracking for initial implementation; full analytics will be added in a future phase
- Q: Should banner slots have different sizes or positions on the page? ‚Üí A: Yes, slots have unique dimensions and positions (e.g., header banner, sidebar, footer) for flexible ad placement

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an event organizer, I want to display advertisement banners on my event's public page so that I can generate revenue or showcase sponsors. I need to be able to upload banner graphics from my admin dashboard and have them appear in designated spaces on the event page that visitors can see.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an authenticated event organizer viewing my event's admin dashboard, **When** I navigate to the advertisement/banner management section, **Then** I should see 5 banner slots that I can configure
2. **Given** I have selected a banner image file (JPEG/PNG/WebP, under 5MB) to upload and chosen slot number 3, **When** I submit the upload, **Then** the system should accept the file, associate it with my event in slot 3, and optionally save a click URL if provided
3. **Given** I have uploaded banners to slots 1 and 3 for my event, **When** a visitor views my event's public page, **Then** the banners should be visible in their assigned slot positions on the page
4. **Given** I have uploaded multiple banners to different slots, **When** I view the banner management section, **Then** I should be able to see all 5 slots with their current banner assignments and manage them
5. **Given** I want to remove or replace a banner in slot 2, **When** I perform the deletion/update action, **Then** the banner should no longer appear in slot 2 on the public event page (or the new banner should replace it)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an organizer uploads a banner that exceeds 5MB or is not in JPEG/PNG/WebP format?
- How does the system handle banner visibility when no banners have been uploaded for an event?
- What happens when an organizer tries to activate more than 5 banner slots?
- How are banners displayed on mobile devices vs desktop (especially for different slot sizes)?
- What happens if a banner file is corrupted or fails to load on the public page?
- How does the system handle banners with dimensions that don't match the slot's expected size?
- What happens when an organizer uploads a banner to a slot with very different aspect ratio requirements?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The public event page MUST have designated spaces/slots for displaying advertisement banners
- **FR-002**: Event organizers MUST be able to access a banner management interface from the admin dashboard
- **FR-003**: Event organizers MUST be able to upload banner graphic files for their events
- **FR-004**: The system MUST validate uploaded banner files to accept only JPEG, PNG, or WebP formats with a maximum file size of 5MB; recommended dimensions are 1200x300px
- **FR-005**: Uploaded banners MUST be associated with the specific event they are uploaded for
- **FR-006**: The system MUST display uploaded banners on the event's public page in the designated spaces
- **FR-007**: Event organizers MUST be able to view all banners they have uploaded for an event
- **FR-008**: Event organizers MUST be able to delete banners they have previously uploaded
- **FR-009**: Each event MUST support up to 5 banner slots that can be individually activated or deactivated by the organizer
- **FR-010**: Each banner MUST be assigned to a specific slot number (1 through 5), with only one banner per slot
- **FR-011**: The system MUST support optional click URLs for banners; when a banner has a click URL configured, clicking the banner must redirect visitors to that URL in a new tab
- **FR-012**: Event organizers MUST be able to assign each banner to a specific slot position when uploading or editing the banner
- **FR-013**: Banners MUST remain visible on the event page for the entire duration the event is publicly accessible; no time-based scheduling or start/end dates are required
- **FR-014**: All tenant administrators (admins belonging to the agency or hotel organizing the event) MUST be able to upload, edit, and delete banners for events within their tenant
- **FR-015**: Banners MUST be visible to all visitors viewing the public event page (no authentication required)
- **FR-016**: The system MUST store banner files securely and serve them efficiently to page visitors
- **FR-017**: The system is NOT REQUIRED to track banner impressions or clicks in the initial implementation; analytics features may be added in a future phase
- **FR-018**: Each of the 5 banner slots MUST have unique dimensions and page positions to allow flexible ad placement (e.g., header banners, sidebar ads, footer banners in different sections of the event page)

### Key Entities

- **Banner**: Represents an advertisement banner uploaded by an event organizer
  - Associated with a specific Event
  - Assigned to a specific slot number (1-5)
  - Contains graphic file reference (JPEG, PNG, or WebP format; max 5MB; recommended 1200x300px)
  - Optional click URL (for redirecting visitors when banner is clicked)
  - Visibility tied to event's public accessibility (no independent scheduling)

- **Banner Slot**: Represents a designated space on the event page where banners can be displayed
  - Maximum of 5 slots per event (numbered 1-5)
  - Each slot has unique dimensions and page position (e.g., slot 1 = header banner, slot 2 = sidebar, etc.)
  - Each slot can be individually activated or deactivated
  - Each slot displays exactly one banner
  - Slot layout allows for flexible ad placement across different page areas

- **Event**: Existing entity that will have relationship to Banners
  - One event can have multiple banners

## Summary of Clarifications Needed

The specification has been created but requires clarification on the following points before implementation planning:

1. **File Requirements**: Acceptable formats, max file size, dimension requirements/constraints
2. **Banner Capacity**: How many banners per event (fixed slots or unlimited)?
3. **Display Behavior**: Do multiple banners rotate in same slot or does each have a fixed position?
4. **Clickability**: Are banners clickable links requiring URL configuration?
5. **Ordering/Priority**: Can organizers control banner positioning and display order?
6. **Scheduling**: Can organizers set start/end dates for banner visibility?
7. **Permissions**: Who can upload banners - only event creator or all event admins?
8. **Analytics**: Should the system track banner impressions or clicks?
9. **Banner Slots**: Are slots predefined in the page layout or dynamically configurable?
10. **Slot Types**: Different slot sizes/types for different page areas?
