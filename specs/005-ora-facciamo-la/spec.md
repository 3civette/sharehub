# Feature Specification: Event Management Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `005-ora-facciamo-la`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ora facciamo la dashboard dell'evento (dove si possono copiare i token tra le altre cose)"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08
- Q: What is the scope of the event dashboard? ‚Üí A: Comprehensive hub - Event info, tokens, plus embedded lists/management of sessions, speeches, and photos all on one page
- Q: Should the dashboard display QR codes for access tokens? ‚Üí A: No inline QR display. Text copy for both tokens. Participant token gets "download" button to generate QR code file/image
- Q: Should the dashboard show event metrics, and if so, which ones? ‚Üí A: Cached summary metrics - Static counts refreshed periodically (page views, slide downloads, total participants)
- Q: Should the dashboard provide bulk actions for event content? ‚Üí A: No - Only individual item management, no bulk operations
- Q: Can admins regenerate or manage token expiration from the dashboard? ‚Üí A: no
- Q: Should there be visual warnings when tokens are about to expire? ‚Üí A: No - Just display expiration date, no special warnings

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Event-specific dashboard for managing individual events
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Admin users managing events
   ‚Üí Actions: View event details, copy tokens, manage event resources
   ‚Üí Data: Event information, access tokens, event metrics
   ‚Üí Constraints: Admin must own the event (tenant-based access)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What other management actions besides copying tokens?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should dashboard show real-time metrics or static data?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens when tokens are copied - just clipboard or other actions?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: Admin navigates to event dashboard, views details, copies tokens
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Token management, event overview, navigation, security
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Event, AccessToken, Session, Speech, EventPhoto, Slide
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - marked for clarification"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an event organizer, I need a comprehensive dashboard for each event where I can view all event details at a glance, copy access tokens to share with participants, and manage all event-specific resources (sessions, speeches, photos) in one centralized location. This eliminates the need to navigate between multiple pages and provides a single "mission control" view for the entire event.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an admin is logged in and viewing their events list, **When** they click on a specific event, **Then** they should see a comprehensive dashboard showing event overview, metrics summary, tokens (if private), sessions list, speeches list, and photos gallery
2. **Given** an admin is on an event dashboard for a private event, **When** they click the "copy" button next to an organizer token, **Then** the token should be copied to their clipboard with visual confirmation
3. **Given** an admin is on an event dashboard for a private event, **When** they click the "copy" button next to a participant token, **Then** the token should be copied to their clipboard with visual confirmation
4. **Given** an admin is on an event dashboard for a private event, **When** they click the "download" button next to a participant token, **Then** a QR code image file should be generated and downloaded containing the token for easy sharing
5. **Given** an admin is on an event dashboard, **When** they view the event overview section, **Then** they should see key event details (name, date, visibility, status, description)
6. **Given** an admin is on an event dashboard for a public event, **When** they look for tokens, **Then** no token section should be displayed (public events don't use tokens)
7. **Given** an admin is on an event dashboard, **When** they view the sessions section, **Then** they should see a list of all sessions with ability to add, edit, or delete sessions inline
8. **Given** an admin is on an event dashboard, **When** they view the speeches section, **Then** they should see speeches organized by session with ability to manage them inline
9. **Given** an admin is on an event dashboard, **When** they view the photos section, **Then** they should see a gallery of event photos with ability to upload or delete photos inline
10. **Given** an admin is on an event dashboard, **When** they view the metrics section, **Then** they should see cached summary statistics including total page views, slide downloads, and participant count

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an admin tries to access an event dashboard for an event they don't own (different tenant)?
- What happens when tokens expire while viewing the dashboard?
- How does the system handle copying tokens on mobile devices vs desktop?
- What happens if the event has no tokens generated yet (for private events)?
- What happens when there are no sessions, speeches, or photos yet (empty state handling)?
- How does the dashboard handle events with many sessions/speeches (pagination or scrolling)?
- What happens when metrics are still being calculated (first load, no data yet)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display an event-specific dashboard accessible via a unique URL pattern (e.g., /admin/events/{id}/dashboard)
- **FR-002**: System MUST show event overview information including name, date, visibility, status, and description
- **FR-002a**: System MUST display cached metrics summary including total page views, slide downloads, and participant count
- **FR-003**: System MUST display access tokens (organizer and participant) for private events with copy-to-clipboard functionality
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a download button for participant tokens that generates and downloads a QR code image file
- **FR-005**: System MUST NOT display QR codes inline on the dashboard
- **FR-006**: System MUST NOT display access tokens for public events
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide visual confirmation when tokens are successfully copied to clipboard
- **FR-008**: System MUST restrict access to event dashboards based on tenant ownership (RLS policies)
- **FR-009**: System MUST show token metadata including expiration date, usage count, and last used timestamp (read-only display)
- **FR-009a**: System MUST NOT allow token regeneration or expiration modification from the dashboard
- **FR-009b**: System MUST NOT display special warnings or badges for expiring tokens (plain date display only)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide navigation link to edit event details and view public event page
- **FR-011**: System MUST display a list of all sessions for the event with inline management capabilities (add, edit, delete)
- **FR-012**: System MUST display a list of all speeches organized by session with inline management capabilities
- **FR-013**: System MUST display an event photos gallery with inline upload and delete capabilities
- **FR-014**: System MUST show session metadata (title, start time, end time, room/location)
- **FR-015**: System MUST show speech metadata (title, speaker, session assignment, slide count)
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle empty states gracefully (no sessions, no speeches, no photos) with prompts to add content
- **FR-017**: System MUST refresh cached metrics periodically (not real-time) to minimize performance impact
- **FR-018**: System MUST NOT provide bulk actions (download all slides, export data) - individual management only

### Key Entities
- **Event**: The main entity being managed - includes basic info (name, date, status, visibility) and relationships to all event resources
- **AccessToken**: Security tokens for private events - includes token string, type (organizer/participant), expiration, usage tracking (read-only on dashboard, managed elsewhere)
- **Session**: Time blocks within an event - displayed and manageable from dashboard with inline add/edit/delete
- **Speech**: Presentations within sessions - listed on dashboard organized by session with inline management
- **EventPhoto**: Gallery photos for the event - displayed in gallery view on dashboard with inline upload/delete
- **Slide**: Presentation files attached to speeches - accessible via speech metadata (slide count shown)

## Notes for Planning Phase

This feature builds on Feature 005 (Event Flow Management) and requires:
- Existing event, token, session, speech, photo, and slide data structures
- Tenant-based RLS policies already in place
- Authentication system for admin access

**Scope Confirmed**: Comprehensive "mission control" dashboard showing all event resources with inline management capabilities. This centralizes event management in one page rather than requiring navigation between multiple dedicated pages.
