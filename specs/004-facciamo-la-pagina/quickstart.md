## Test Scenario 1: View Public Event

**Goal**: Verify public event display with sessions, speeches, and slides

### Setup
1. Create a public event via admin panel:
   - Name: "Tech Conference 2025"
   - Slug: "tech-conf-2025"
   - Visibility: Public
   - Status: Upcoming
   - Date: 2025-12-15

2. Add 2 sessions:
   - Session 1: "Morning Keynotes" (display_order: 1)
   - Session 2: "Afternoon Workshops" (display_order: 2)

3. Add 2 speeches to Session 1:
   - Speech 1: "Welcome Address" by "Jane Doe" (display_order: 1)
   - Speech 2: "Industry Trends" by "John Smith" (display_order: 2)

4. Upload 2 slides to Speech 1:
   - welcome-slide1.pdf
   - welcome-slide2.pdf

### Test Steps
```bash
# 1. Navigate to public event page
open http://localhost:3000/events/tech-conf-2025

# 2. Verify page loads < 2s (check Network tab)

# 3. Check event header displays:
# - Event name: "Tech Conference 2025"
# - Event date: "Dec 15, 2025"
# - Status badge: "Upcoming" (blue)
# - Public metrics: "X views Â· Y downloads"

# 4. Verify sessions are EXPANDED (visible by default)

curl -I http://localhost:3001/api/public/slides/{slide-id}/download
# Expected: HTTP 302 redirect to signed Supabase URL

# 9. Download speech ZIP
curl -O http://localhost:3001/api/public/speeches/{speech-id}/download-zip
# Expected: welcome-address-slides.zip containing 2 PDFs

## Test Scenario 2: Access Private Event with Token

**Goal**: Verify token validation flow for private events

### Setup
1. Create a private event via admin panel:
   - Name: "Internal Strategy Meeting"
   - Slug: "strategy-2025"
   - Visibility: Private
   - Generate participant token (save for testing)

2. Add 1 session with 1 speech and 1 slide

### Test Steps
```bash
# 1. Navigate to private event WITHOUT token
open http://localhost:3000/events/strategy-2025

# 2. Verify access denied page shows:
# - Message: "This is a private event. Please enter your access token."
# - Token input form (21 characters)
# - "Access Event" button

# 3. Enter INVALID token (wrong format)
# Expected: Error "Token must be exactly 21 characters"

# 4. Enter VALID token (from setup step 1)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/public/events/strategy-2025/validate-token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token": "AbC123XyZ456PqR789Lmn"}'
# Expected: { "valid": true, "token_type": "participant", "expires_at": "..." }

# 5. Verify token stored in sessionStorage
# Open DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Session Storage â†’ event-token-{event_id}
# Expected: Token value present

# 6. Refresh page
# Expected: Event content loads automatically (no token re-entry required)

# 7. Close tab, reopen
open http://localhost:3000/events/strategy-2025
# Expected: Token form shown again (sessionStorage cleared on tab close)
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Private event blocks access without token
- [x] Token form validates format (21 chars)
- [x] Valid token grants access
- [x] Token persists in sessionStorage
- [x] Auto-revalidation on page load
- [x] Session cleared on tab close

## Test Scenario 3: Rate Limiting

**Goal**: Verify 50 downloads/hour IP limit

### Setup
Use existing public event from Scenario 1

### Test Steps
```bash
# 1. Download slides 50 times from same IP
for i in {1..50}; do
  curl -I http://localhost:3001/api/public/slides/{slide-id}/download
done
# Expected: All requests return HTTP 302

# 2. Attempt 51st download
curl -I http://localhost:3001/api/public/slides/{slide-id}/download
# Expected: HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
# Expected: Retry-After header present (seconds until reset)

# 3. Check error response body
curl http://localhost:3001/api/public/slides/{slide-id}/download
# Expected: {
#   "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
#   "message": "Download limit reached (50/hour). Please try again in X minutes."
# }

# 4. Wait 1 hour OR restart backend (clears in-memory store)

# 5. Verify downloads work again
curl -I http://localhost:3001/api/public/slides/{slide-id}/download
# Expected: HTTP 302 redirect
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] First 50 downloads succeed
- [x] 51st download returns HTTP 429
- [x] Retry-After header present
- [x] Error message user-friendly
- [x] Limit resets after 1 hour

#   - Time to First Byte (TTFB): < 500ms
#   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2s
#   - Total page load: < 2s

# 5. Check payload size
