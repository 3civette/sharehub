## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08
- Q: Should the 3Civette design system apply to public event pages (accessible by attendees/guests), or only to admin pages? ‚Üí A: Both admin pages and public event pages
- Q: How should tenant custom branding interact with the 3Civette design system? ‚Üí A: 3Civette design system serves as default, tenant branding (colors and logo) can override it when configured
- Q: Is the application's brand identity changing to "3Civette" or remaining "shareHub" with 3Civette design guidelines? ‚Üí A: Complete rebrand to "Meeting Hub"
- Q: Should the system validate tenant custom colors for accessibility compliance, or allow any colors the tenant chooses? ‚Üí A: Allow any colors but show warning to admin if accessibility fails
- Q: Which icon system should be used throughout the application? ‚Üí A: Lucide React

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an admin user, I want the Meeting Hub interface to adopt a professional, elegant design system that makes the application feel more trustworthy and refined, so that it better represents the quality of service we provide to hotels and conference centers.

As a hotel manager accessing the public event page, I want the interface to look polished and modern with clear visual hierarchy, so that I feel confident sharing the link with my guests.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an admin views any page in the dashboard, **When** they observe the visual design, **Then** they see:
   - Consistent black (#0B0B0C) and ink (#111827) text colors
   - Gold (#D4AF37) accent color on primary CTAs
   - Rounded corners (16-20px radius) on cards and buttons
   - Clean silver borders (#E5E7EB) separating content sections
   - Proper spacing using 4px increments (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px)

2. **Given** an admin clicks a primary button, **When** the button is in normal, hover, or active state, **Then** they see:
   - Gold background with black text and uppercase tracking
   - Subtle brightness decrease (-8%) on hover
   - Visible shadow effect
   - Disabled state clearly distinguished

3. **Given** an admin uses keyboard navigation, **When** they tab through interactive elements, **Then** they see:
   - Visible focus ring (2px gold) on all focusable elements
   - Logical tab order following visual layout
   - Skip-to-content link at the top of pages

4. **Given** a user with low vision, **When** they use the interface, **Then** all text meets:
   - AA contrast ratio minimum (AAA preferred)
   - Gold on black passes contrast requirements
   - Text on white backgrounds remains readable

5. **Given** an admin views forms, **When** they interact with inputs, **Then** they see:
   - Visible labels (not placeholder-only)
   - Silver borders with gold focus ring
   - Error messages in red (#dc2626) positioned below fields
   - Success feedback via toast notifications

6. **Given** an admin views the event list or dashboard, **When** they observe cards, **Then** they see:
   - White background with subtle shadow
   - 16-20px rounded corners
   - Proper spacing between title, description, and actions (16/8/16px)
   - Hover effect with subtle lift and enhanced shadow

7. **Given** a user views the interface on mobile, **When** the viewport is narrow, **Then** they see:
   - Responsive grid collapsing from 3 columns to 1
   - Hamburger menu on header
   - Full-height off-canvas navigation with proper focus trap
   - Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44√ó44px)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when tenant has not configured custom branding? (Uses 3Civette defaults)
- What if tenant custom colors fail accessibility contrast requirements? (Show warning but allow)
- How do icons maintain consistency across the application? (Lucide React 24√ó24px throughout)
- How do secondary buttons appear in disabled state?
- What happens to existing custom components that don't fit the design system?
