## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a MICE agency**, I want to purchase a Meeting Hub account so that I can manage my event portfolio with branded event pages and control access to presentation materials through secure tokens.

**User Journey**:
1. Agency discovers Meeting Hub through 3Civette's marketing
2. Signs up via self-service signup form (email, password, company details) with immediate account activation
3. Completes agency profile setup (company name, logo, contact info)
4. Creates their first event through the admin dashboard
5. Customizes event branding (colors, logo) to match client's brand
6. Uploads up to 5 promotional banners for the event page
7. Receives two tokens: one for speakers to upload slides, one for participants to access materials
8. Shares event page URL with participants
9. Monitors event metrics from dashboard
10. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Post-event data retention?] Archives or deletes event after completion

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Agency Account Creation**
- **Given** a MICE agency wants to use Meeting Hub
- **When** they complete the self-service signup form with email, password, and company details
- **Then** their account is created and immediately activated
- **And** they receive access to an admin dashboard with 3Civette branding
- **And** they can create their first event immediately

**Scenario 2: Event Branding Customization**
- **Given** an agency has created an event
- **When** they navigate to the event's branding settings
- **Then** they can upload a custom logo for the event
- **And** they can configure a complete color palette (primary, secondary, accent, background colors)
- **And** they can select a font family from 3-5 preimpostato options (e.g., sans-serif, serif, modern)
- **And** the public event page reflects all these customizations
- **But** the admin interface retains 3Civette branding (not customizable)

**Scenario 3: Banner Management**
- **Given** an agency is editing an event
- **When** they access the banner management section
- **Then** they can upload up to 5 banner images (JPEG/PNG/WebP, max 5MB each)
- **And** each banner is assigned to a specific slot (1-5) with unique dimensions and positions
- **And** each banner can optionally include a click URL to redirect visitors
- **And** banners are displayed on the public event page in their assigned slot positions
- **But** they cannot upload more than 5 banners per event (one per slot)

**Scenario 4: Token Generation and Distribution**
- **Given** an event has been created
- **When** the agency views the event dashboard
- **Then** two tokens are automatically generated and displayed
- **And** the "slide upload token" allows speakers to upload their presentations
- **And** the "participant access token" allows attendees to view/download materials
- **And** tokens automatically expire 7 days after the event date
- **But** tokens cannot be regenerated once created

**Scenario 5: Multi-Event Management**
- **Given** an agency manages multiple events
- **When** they view their dashboard
- **Then** they see a list of all their events (upcoming, ongoing, past)
- **And** they can filter/sort events by date, status, or name
- **And** each event shows key metrics (views, downloads, participants)

### Edge Cases

**Account & Subscription**
- What happens when an agency's [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: subscription expires or payment fails]?
- Can agencies cancel their account? What happens to their event data?
- Can multiple users from the same agency access the same account?
- What happens if signup email already exists?
- What email validation and password strength requirements apply?

**Branding & Design**
- What if uploaded logos don't meet requirements (max 2MB, JPEG/PNG/SVG, recommended 400x100px)?
- Should the system validate color contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG AA compliance)?
- Can branding (colors, fonts, logo) be changed after an event has started or been published?
- What happens if an agency selects colors that make text unreadable (e.g., white text on white background)?
- Should there be a preview mode to test branding before applying it to the public page?

**Token Security**
- What happens if tokens are shared publicly or leaked? (Cannot be regenerated, so agency must wait for expiration)
- Tokens expire automatically 7 days after the event date
- What if speakers need to upload slides after the token has expired?
- What if participants need access to materials after the 7-day expiration period?

**Banner Management** (Already implemented - feature 010)
- Accepts JPEG, PNG, WebP (max 5MB per banner)
- 5 slots per event, each with unique dimensions and positions
- No scheduling - banners visible for entire event duration
- Immediate publication without approval process
- Click URLs optional (open in new tabs)

**Data & Privacy**
- How long is event data retained after an event ends?
- Can agencies export their event data?
- What happens to participant data (email addresses, download logs)?
