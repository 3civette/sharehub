## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input

3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens to existing thumbnails when feature is disabled?]

   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Cost limit or rate limiting for CloudConvert API?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: Admin enables thumbnails, uploads slide, sees generated thumbnail
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Event settings, Slide thumbnails, CloudConvert jobs
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - 3 clarification points needed"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-13

- Q: When an admin enables thumbnails for an existing event that already has uploaded slides, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Retroactive generation only for slides without existing thumbnails (incremental approach)
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable time for thumbnail generation to complete before timing out? ‚Üí A: 5 minutes
- Q: Should the thumbnail generation toggle be available during event creation, or only in edit mode after the event exists? ‚Üí A: Available during event creation
- Q: How should the system handle CloudConvert API costs and usage limits? ‚Üí A: Each tenant gets 5 free thumbnails with cost transparency (show remaining quota to admins), hard limit after quota exhausted, with the option to purchase more in the future (freemium model)
- Q: Should admins receive notifications if thumbnail generation repeatedly fails for an event? ‚Üí A: Yes, send email notifications to admins after repeated thumbnail generation failures

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an event administrator, I want to automatically generate thumbnail previews of uploaded presentation slides so that attendees can quickly browse and identify presentations of interest without downloading full files. I also want the ability to control whether thumbnail generation is enabled for each event, to manage API costs and processing time.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an event with thumbnail generation enabled, **When** an admin uploads a PowerPoint or PDF slide deck, **Then** the system automatically generates a thumbnail from the first slide and displays it in the speech card on the dashboard.

2. **Given** an event with thumbnail generation disabled, **When** an admin uploads a slide deck, **Then** no thumbnail is generated and the speech card shows a generic placeholder icon.

3. **Given** an existing event without thumbnail generation enabled, **When** an admin enables the thumbnail toggle in event settings, **Then** the system automatically queues thumbnail generation for all existing slides that don't already have thumbnails (incremental retroactive generation).

4. **Given** an event with thumbnail generation enabled, **When** a thumbnail generation fails (CloudConvert error, unsupported format, etc.), **Then** the system displays a clear error indicator and allows retry without blocking the slide upload.

5. **Given** multiple admins uploading slides concurrently, **When** thumbnails are being generated, **Then** each thumbnail generation job is processed independently without blocking other uploads.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when CloudConvert API is unavailable or rate-limited?
- How does the system handle very large presentation files (>100MB)?
- What happens if an admin toggles thumbnail generation off mid-upload?
- Should there be a batch "regenerate all thumbnails" action for an event?
- How are thumbnail storage costs managed if an event has hundreds of slides?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Thumbnail Generation
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate thumbnail images from the first slide of uploaded presentations (PPT, PPTX, PDF) when thumbnail generation is enabled for the event
- **FR-002**: System MUST use CloudConvert API to convert the first slide to a preview image
- **FR-003**: Thumbnail generation MUST be asynchronous and not block the slide upload process
- **FR-004**: System MUST display a loading indicator while thumbnail is being generated
- **FR-005**: System MUST store generated thumbnails in cloud storage (R2) with appropriate naming convention
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle thumbnail generation failures gracefully and allow manual retry
- **FR-007**: Thumbnail generation MUST complete within 5 minutes (300 seconds)

#### Event-Level Toggle
- **FR-008**: Event admins MUST be able to enable/disable thumbnail generation for each event independently via a toggle switch in event edit form
- **FR-009**: Thumbnail generation setting MUST be saved as part of event configuration
- **FR-010**: System MUST respect the thumbnail generation setting when processing new slide uploads
- **FR-011**: System MUST display the current thumbnail generation status clearly in the event edit interface
- **FR-012**: Thumbnail generation toggle MUST be accessible during event creation, allowing admins to enable the feature from the start

#### Display & User Interface
- **FR-013**: Dashboard MUST display generated thumbnails in speech cards when available
- **FR-014**: System MUST show appropriate status badges: "Generating thumbnail...", "Thumbnail ready", "Thumbnail failed", or generic icon when disabled
- **FR-015**: Thumbnails MUST be visually distinguishable from placeholder icons
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide a fallback placeholder for events/speeches without thumbnails enabled

#### Error Handling & Monitoring
- **FR-017**: System MUST log all CloudConvert API errors with sufficient context for debugging
- **FR-018**: System MUST track thumbnail generation success/failure rates per event
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide clear error messages to admins when thumbnail generation fails
- **FR-020**: System MUST send email notifications to event admins after repeated thumbnail generation failures (e.g., 3+ consecutive failures)

#### Cost Management
- **FR-021**: System MUST enforce a hard limit of 5 free thumbnails per tenant, blocking thumbnail generation after quota is exhausted
- **FR-022**: System MUST display remaining thumbnail quota to admins in a visible location (e.g., event settings, dashboard)
- **FR-023**: System MUST provide clear messaging when thumbnail quota is exhausted with information about purchasing additional thumbnails (future feature)

### Key Entities

- **Event Settings**: Configuration for each event including thumbnail generation enabled/disabled flag. Each event independently controls whether slides uploaded to its sessions should have thumbnails generated.

- **Slide Metadata**: Stored information about each uploaded presentation including thumbnail status ("pending", "processing", "completed", "failed", "none"), thumbnail storage path (R2 key), and generation timestamp.

- **CloudConvert Job**: External API job tracking including job ID, status, conversion parameters, and result. Used for monitoring asynchronous thumbnail generation progress and handling errors.

- **Thumbnail Image**: Generated preview image (JPEG/PNG) stored in R2 with dimensions optimized for display in speech cards (e.g., 300x300px). Linked to parent slide via R2 key reference.

## Clarified Decisions Summary

All clarification questions have been answered. Key decisions:

1. **Retroactive thumbnail generation**: Incremental approach - generate thumbnails only for slides that don't already have them when feature is enabled
2. **Timeout**: 5 minutes (300 seconds) for CloudConvert thumbnail generation
3. **Cost management**: 5 free thumbnails per tenant with hard limit, cost transparency via quota display, future option to purchase more
4. **Toggle availability**: Available during event creation (not edit-only)
5. **Failure notifications**: Email notifications to admins after repeated failures (3+ consecutive)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Specification complete and ready for planning phase. Run `/plan` to generate implementation plan.
