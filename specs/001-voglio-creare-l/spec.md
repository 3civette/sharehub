## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: What key metrics should the dashboard display to hotel administrators? ‚Üí A: Minimal: only active upcoming events count and recent activity timestamp
- Q: Which management pages should be accessible from the dashboard navigation? ‚Üí A: Events + Branding + Settings (admin account, notifications, preferences)
- Q: What quick actions should be available directly from the dashboard (without navigating to other pages)? ‚Üí A: Create New Event + View All Events buttons
- Q: Should the dashboard display visual charts/graphs or just numerical data? ‚Üí A: Mixed: numbers for key metrics + small trend indicators
- Q: Should the dashboard show a recent activity log? If yes, what should be logged? ‚Üí A: Yes - minimal log showing last 3-5 recent events (any activity type)

### System Architecture Context
The ShareHub platform follows this structure:
1. **Hotel Admin** manages their account through the dashboard
2. **From Dashboard**, hotel can:
   - Configure default branding (colors, logo)
   - Manage advertisements/promotional content
   - Create events
3. **Each Event generates two tokens**:
   - **Organizer Token**: Used by event organizer to upload slides/presentations
   - **Participant Token**: Used by event attendees to view and download materials
4. **Event Branding Inheritance**:
   - New events inherit hotel's default branding automatically
   - Hotel admin can control customization at granular level (per-style-element)
   - Each branding element (colors, logo, advertisements) has individual customization flag
   - If customization is disabled for an element, that element strictly uses hotel branding

5. **Branding Configuration Interface**:
   - Hotel-level branding is configurable from hotel admin settings page
   - Event-level branding is configurable from individual event admin page
   - Both interfaces provide simple, user-friendly controls for all branding elements
   - Changes are immediately applied and preview-able

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a hotel administrator, when I log into the ShareHub admin panel, I need to see a comprehensive dashboard that gives me an overview of my hotel's events, presentations, and system status so that I can quickly understand activity and take necessary actions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a hotel admin performs login, **When** authentication succeeds, **Then** they are automatically redirected to their hotel dashboard
2. **Given** an authenticated admin user, **When** they navigate to the dashboard, **Then** they see their hotel name and key metrics about events and presentations
3. **Given** an admin viewing the dashboard, **When** they want to manage specific areas (events, branding, slides), **Then** they can navigate to dedicated management pages from the dashboard
4. **Given** a multi-tenant system, **When** an admin views their dashboard, **Then** they only see data relevant to their specific hotel/tenant
5. **Given** an admin creates a new event, **When** the event is saved, **Then** the system generates both an organizer token (for slide upload) and a participant token (for viewing/downloading)
6. **Given** an admin views event details, **When** they access token information, **Then** they can see and copy both organizer and participant tokens
7. **Given** an admin creates a new event, **When** the event is created, **Then** it inherits the hotel's default branding (colors, logo, advertisements)
8. **Given** an admin configures event settings, **When** they set branding customization policy, **Then** they can choose individually for each branding element (colors, logo, advertisements) whether organizer can customize it
9. **Given** an admin accesses hotel branding page, **When** they modify branding elements, **Then** they can easily change colors, upload logo, and configure advertisements through simple interface
10. **Given** an admin accesses event-specific settings, **When** they modify event branding, **Then** they can override hotel defaults with simple controls for each customizable element

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a hotel has no events yet?
- How does the dashboard handle a hotel with hundreds of events?
- What is displayed for newly created hotel accounts?
- How should the dashboard behave on mobile devices?
